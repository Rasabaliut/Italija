            The Leaning Tower of Pisa, also known as the Torre Pendente di Pisa, is an architectural marvel.
            It gained fame for its unintended tilt and remains one of the most recognized landmarks in the world.The Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of the most fascinating architectural marvels in the world. Here are some interesting facts about it:
<hr> <br>
            1. The Lean Was an Accident
            The tower wasn’t meant to lean! Construction began in 1173, and it started tilting during its construction due to a weak, unstable foundation made of clay and sand.
            <br><br>
            2. It Took Nearly 200 Years to Build
            Construction was delayed multiple times due to wars and financial troubles, which actually helped the tower. The pauses allowed the soil beneath to settle, preventing a complete collapse.
            <br><br>
            3. It’s Not the Only Leaning Tower in Pisa
            Pisa is home to multiple leaning structures, including the Bell Tower of the Church of San Michele degli Scalzi and San Nicola Church, as they share the same unstable ground.
            <br><br>
            4. The Lean Was Fixed, but Not Entirely
            In the 1990s, engineers worked to stabilize the tower by removing soil from beneath it and adding counterweights. They managed to reduce the tilt from 5.5 degrees to 3.97 degrees, ensuring it would remain safe for at least another 200 years.
           <br><br>
            5. It’s a Bell Tower
            The Leaning Tower of Pisa is actually the freestanding bell tower of the nearby Pisa Cathedral. It has seven bells, each corresponding to a musical note.
            <br><br>
            6. It’s a Tourist Magnet
            The tower attracts millions of visitors every year, who often pose for playful photos pretending to hold it up or push it over!
