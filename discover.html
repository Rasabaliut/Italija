        The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome.
        It was used for gladiatorial contests, public spectacles, and other events.
        Today, it is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world and a testament to ancient Roman engineering and culture.
        The Colosseum was commissioned by Emperor Vespasian of the Flavian dynasty in 70-72 AD as a gift to the Roman people. It was constructed on the site of Emperor Nero’s extravagant Golden House, symbolizing a return to the people after the excesses of Nero’s reign. The construction was completed in 80 AD under Emperor Titus, with subsequent modifications by his successor, Emperor Domitian.
        The amphitheater was built using travertine stone, tuff, and concrete. Its architecture is a marvel, featuring a sophisticated system of vaults and arches that allowed it to support the immense weight of the structure while creating a massive interior space.
